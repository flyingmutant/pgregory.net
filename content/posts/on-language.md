# On language

Language has a special role in the universe around us.\
Language is inseparable from a set of programs and executions it elicits.\
Physical reality is elicited by a language of physical laws.\
Biological life is elicited by a language of DNA.\
We spend our lives looking for the language that describes things, and believe it exists.\
GÃ¶del and Kolmogorov say that we can't really find that language,\
but we believe in the fundamental value of the search.\
A neural network is a search procedure for a special case of a language to describe things.\
"In the beginning was the Word" is eerily similar to the description of a system prompt.
